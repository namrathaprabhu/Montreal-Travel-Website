Michele Forgione and Stefano Faita grabbed the attention of Montreal diners in 2013 with this finely-tuned Little Italy collaborazione. Now the duo has Gema, a fine pizzeria, down the street, and casse-croûte Chez Tousignant around the corner.</p>

ile Ex restaurant Manitoba fittingly just feels like Canada — and in a remarkably modern and fresh way that steers well away from tropes of maple syrup or lumberjacks. Chef Simon Mathys (ex-Bistro Accords) heads up a kitchen that deals in hearty meats and game and ample root vegetables; their winter offerings still feel local, but without seasonal affective disorder, and in summer, the restaurant's backyard is one of the top terrasses in town. It's topped off with a neatly-curated natural wine list, too.</p>

Damas was Montreal's comeback restaurant of 2015. The story has been well-circulated by now: the original Damas was gutted by fire a year ago. Chef-owner Fuad Alnirabie's reborn Syrian restaurant in Outremont, in the old Les Chèvres, is more ambitious, more popular, and, indeed, just as excellent as ever.  </p>

Derek Dammann, prominent chef ambassador for Montreal that he is, is an ardent advocate of a Canada-wide culinary identity (indeed, his cookbook, True North: Canadian Cooking From Coast to Coast, is all about it). His popular Plateau gastropub brings it all home.</p>

Montreal band Arcade Fire's foray into the restaurant world could have come across as a meritless vanity project. But together with top Toronto restaurateurs Jen Agg and Roland Jean it's a success, with boozy rum-based cocktails and Haitian plates such as griot or oxtail, rice and plantains</p>
