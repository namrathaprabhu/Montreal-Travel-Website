    <p class="historycontent"> <span class="h2colorneigh"> Montreal is home to more than 200 ethnic groups that have all stitched their own patches into the urban quilt, and the city is full of distinct neighborhoods, some created hundreds of years ago and others born of the 21st century.
    Many of them are hosting special events this year as the city celebrates its 375th birthday. But in any year, the city's diverse districts provide visitors with much to explore. 
    "It's definitely a city of boroughs and neighborhoods," said Danny Pavlopoulos, who guides Montreal foodie tours for Spade and Palacio. "There are so many. And they're so close together. And they're all so different.</span></p>

<p class="paragraphneigh">
Today, the city's oldest district, founded as a fur trading post in 1605 by Samuel de Champlain, is a mélange of shops, bars and sidewalk cafes that attracts visitors and locals in equal measure.
It's also become the hip place to crash on a Montreal sojourn, with hotels like Le Petit Hôtel and the new Hotel William Gray creatively adapting old buildings into cool places to stay.
Thirty years ago, this wasn't the case. Many of the Vieux-Montréal structures were vacant, and most of the residents had fled to other areas, draining the neighborhood of life. But since listed historical buildings cannot be torn down, in recent years people began renovating them into modern business, entertainment and residential spaces.</p>

<p class="paragraphneigh">
Simply called "The Village" by locals, this compact neighborhood sprawls along Rue Sainte-Catherine between the Plateau and the St. Lawrence River.
Once down and out, the area has morphed into a lively dining, drinking and entertainment hub where more than 80 bars and restaurants serve the city's large LGBT community and anyone else looking for an alternative night out. Many of them are hosting special events this year as the city celebrates its 375th birthday. 
"Gay Village is a great example of Montreal's neighborhoods continuing to evolve," Thériault said. "A couple of decades ago, this was the city's roughest area, the only place there was street crime.</p>

<li class="listneigh"> Le Plateau-Mont-Royal</li></ul>
<div class="contneigh">
<p class="historycontent"> <img class="photosizeneigh" src="https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/w_1100,dpr_1.5,c_fill,g_auto,h_619,ar_16:9/http%3A%2F%2Fi2.cdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F170315141231-montreal-le-plateau-victorian-homes-super-169.jpg " alt="Le Plateau-Mont-Royal" /> </p>
<!-- <ul>
<li class="listneigh"> Old Montreal</li></ul> -->
<p class="paragraphneigh">
Life in the hip Plateau neighborhood revolves around the area's bars and cafes and the leafy Parc la Fontaine, with its serpentine lakes and albino squirrels. The neighborhood flanks the north side of Mont Royal and McGill University.
Gentrification has transformed the Plateau into an artsy, upscale neighborhood where residents bike to work and school, "renaturalize" their alleyways with murals and gardens and restore the wrought iron stairs and colorful facades of their Victorian townhouses. Many of them are hosting special events this year as the city celebrates its 375th birthday. But in any year, the city's diverse districts provide visitors with much to explore. </p>

<li class="listneigh"> Mile End/Mile-Ex</li></ul>
<div class="contneigh">

<p class="paragraphneigh">
Montreal's creative cauldron, Mile End is home to artists and writers, musicians and filmmakers, as well as galleries, bookstores and entertainment venues packed into an area that barely covers one square mile.
Anchoring the neighborhood, the neo-baroque Théâtre Rialto is a wonderfully restored 1920s moving-picture palace that now presents a year-round slate of cabaret, comedy, burlesque, dance, music and drama.
As Mile End moves up the food chain, many of the younger, edgier artists have migrated to adjacent Mile-Ex, a former industrial zone now filled with ateliers and hipster hangouts.</p>
